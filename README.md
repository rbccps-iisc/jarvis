## Phrase matcher demo (Need to configure it)
Speak the phrase and then see if the recognition engine successfully recognises it â€” this is another demo that relies on speech recognition, written for a research team at the University of Nebraska at Kearney.

This current works only on Chrome/Chrome Mobile. To get this code running successfully, you'll need to run the code through a web server (localhost will work.)

Type words in the input then submit the form to hear it spoken. You can also select the different voices available on the system, and alter the rate and pitch.

This currently works in Chrome and Firefox.
